# ZipBruteForce
A simple python script to bruteforce any encrypted zip
For using it drag the file or copy it (Bruteforce.py) and download the passwords list (4-Digit.txt & 6-Digit.txt).
For the Script you only need the directory of your encrypted zip and passwords list,
choose the what dictionnary you need (4 or 6 digit passwords) but remenber that you can use any dictionnary of attack.
I have put a encrypted zip file (4 digit password) for testing the zip.
